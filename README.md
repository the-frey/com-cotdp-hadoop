# Hadoop Tools For Databricks

Forked from the original repo [here](https://github.com/cotdp/com-cotdp-hadoop). Thanks to Michael Cutler for writing it.

The source is under the Apache License 2.0 and can freely be reused (see LICENSE).

This has been updated to bump the dependencies so that it works with the current version of Databricks, or hosted Databricks. 

## Build

    mvn package

## Add to Databricks

On the main screen, click 'Add Library', upload the JAR file that appears in `./target` after running `mvn package` and attach it to the notebooks and clusters that are relevant. 

To then use for e.g. opening a zip file, you can follow the tutorial [here](https://docs.databricks.com/spark/latest/data-sources/zip-files.html)
